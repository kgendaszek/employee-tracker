## **Description**
Using `MySql` I created an employee database that employers can use to keep track of their employees.

## **Installation**
The following dependencies needed to be installed:
    `"asciiart-logo"
    "console.table"
    "inquirer"
    "mysql"
    "mysql2"`
  

## **Usage**
Keep track of your employees, their salaries, roles, and departments with this database.
